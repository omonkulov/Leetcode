/****************************************************************
Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

@param {number[]} nums
@param {number} target
@return {number[]}

var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[j] + nums[i] === target) {
        return [i, j];
      }

/*
Richest Customer Wealth
You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
 

Constraints:

m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

var maximumWealth = function (accounts) {
  let max = 0;
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
      total += accounts[i][j];
    }

    if (total > max) max = total;
    total = 0;
  }
  return max;
